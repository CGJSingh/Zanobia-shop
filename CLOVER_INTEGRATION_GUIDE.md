## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Checkout Page Changes:**

**File:** `src/pages/CheckoutPage.jsx`

#### **1. Removed Stripe Imports:**
```javascript
// REMOVED:
import { Elements } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';
import { createPaymentIntent, confirmPaymentAndCreateOrder } from '../api/stripe';
import { stripePromise, isStripeTestMode, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY } from '../config/stripe';
import StripePaymentForm from '../components/payment/StripePaymentForm';

// NOW USES:
import { createOrder } from '../api/woocommerce';
```

#### **2. Simplified State:**
```javascript
// REMOVED:
const [clientSecret, setClientSecret] = useState('');
const [paymentIntentId, setPaymentIntentId] = useState('');
const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState(''); // was 'card', 'apple_pay', 'paypal'

// NOW:
const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState('clover'); // Always Clover
```

#### **3. Updated Payment Handler:**
```javascript
const handlePaymentSuccess = async () => {
  setIsProcessing(true);
  setError('');

  try {
    // Validate fields
    if (!formData.firstName || !formData.lastName || !formData.address || !formData.city || !formData.zipCode) {
      throw new Error('Please fill in all required billing fields');
    }

    if (!selectedRate) {
      throw new Error('Please select a shipping method');
    }

    // Create order with Clover payment
    const orderData = {
      payment_method: 'clover',
      payment_method_title: 'Clover Payment',
      set_paid: false, // Clover handles payment status
      billing: { ... },
      shipping: { ... },
      line_items: [...],
      shipping_lines: [{
        method_id: 'clickship',
        method_title: `ClickShip - ${selectedRate.carrier} ${selectedRate.service}`,
        total: selectedRate.cost.toString()
      }]
    };

    // Create order
    const order = await createOrder(orderData);
    
    if (!order || !order.id) {
      throw new Error('Failed to create order');
    }

    // Clear cart and navigate
    clearCart();
    navigate(`/order-success/${order.id}`, {
      state: {
        orderNumber: order.number,
        orderTotal: finalTotal,
        shippingMethod: `${selectedRate.carrier} - ${selectedRate.service}`,
        items: items
      }
    });
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message || 'Failed to create order. Please try again.');
    setIsProcessing(false);
  }
};
```
