# ✅ Signup Registration - Field Name Fix

## 🔧 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** React was sending `first_name` but WordPress expected `firstName`

**Solution:** Updated field names to match WordPress plugin requirements

---

## 🔄 What Was Changed

### **Before (Wrong):**
```javascript
register({
  first_name: formData.firstName,    ❌ snake_case
  last_name: formData.lastName,      ❌ snake_case
  mobile_phone: formData.mobilePhone,❌ snake_case
  business_name: formData.businessName ❌ snake_case
})
```

### **After (Correct):**
```javascript
register({
  firstName: formData.firstName,     ✅ camelCase
  lastName: formData.lastName,       ✅ camelCase
  mobilePhone: formData.mobilePhone, ✅ camelCase
  businessName: formData.businessName ✅ camelCase
})
```

## 🎯 Complete Payload Now Sent to WordPress

### **What React Sends:**
```json
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "mobilePhone": "1234567890",
  "accountType": "business",
  "businessName": "Test Corporation",
  "role": "business"
}
```

### **What WordPress Expects:**
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "firstName": "John",           ← Matches now ✅
  "lastName": "Doe",             ← Matches now ✅
  "mobilePhone": "1234567890",   ← Matches now ✅
  "accountType": "business",
  "businessName": "Test Corporation", ← Matches now ✅
  "username": "johndoe"
}
```

### **401 Errors for WooCommerce API:**

The errors you see:
```
Failed to load resource: 401
SimilarProducts.jsx:79 Error fetching
```

**These are separate issues:**
- WooCommerce API credentials might be missing/incorrect
- Not related to signup
- Won't affect business registration
