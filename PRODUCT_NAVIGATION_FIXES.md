# Product Navigation & URL Fixes - Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: 404 Errors on Product Detail Pages
**Problem:** 
- Product URLs use slugs (e.g., `/product/mazaya-golden-stripes-glass-large`)
- ProductDetail.jsx was using `getProductById()` which expects numeric IDs
- WooCommerce API returned 404 because slug ≠ ID

**Solution:**
- ✅ Created new function `getProductBySlug()` in woocommerce.js
- ✅ Updated ProductDetail.jsx to fetch by slug first
- ✅ Uses returned product ID for fetching variations

### Issue 2: Scroll Arrow Navigating to Products
**Problem:**
- Scroll hint arrow in SimilarProducts carousel was clickable
- Clicking it would navigate to product pages

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}` to arrow
- ✅ Added `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility
- ✅ Made SVG also have `pointer-events-none`
- ✅ Arrow is now purely decorative

### Issue 3: Authentication Issues
**Problem:**
- Multiple components using old `fetchProducts` function
- Some direct axios calls without authentication

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated all components to use `getProducts()` with built-in auth
- ✅ ProductCarousel.jsx now uses `getProducts()`
- ✅ Home.jsx now uses `getProducts()`
- ✅ SimilarProducts.jsx already uses `getProducts()`

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `src/api/woocommerce.js`
**Added:**
```javascript
export const getProductBySlug = async (slug) => {
  try {
    if (!slug) {
      throw new Error('Product slug is required');
    }
    const response = await woocommerceAPI.get("/products", {
      params: { slug: slug }
    });
    
    if (!response.data || response.data.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('Product not found');
    }
    
    return response.data[0]; // Return first match
  } catch (error) {
    throw handleAPIError(error, `Error fetching product with slug ${slug}`);
  }
};
```

### 2. `src/pages/ProductDetail.jsx`
**Changed:**
- Import: `getProductBySlug` instead of `fetchProduct`
- Renamed variable: `id` → `slug` for clarity
- Updated loadProduct logic:
  ```javascript
  // Old:
  const productResponse = await fetchProduct(id);
  
  // New:
  const productResponse = await getProductBySlug(slug);
  // Then use productResponse.id for variations
  ```

### 3. `src/components/SimilarProducts.jsx`
**Changed:**
- Scroll arrow: Added `style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}`
- Made completely non-interactive

### 4. `src/components/ProductCarousel.jsx`
**Changed:**
- Import: `getProducts` instead of `fetchProducts`
- Updated all `fetchProducts()` calls to `getProducts()`

### 5. `src/pages/Home.jsx`
**Changed:**
- Import: `getProducts` instead of `fetchProducts`
- Updated `fetchProducts()` call to `getProducts()`

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Product Navigation Flow:
```
User clicks product → Navigate to /product/{slug}
    ↓
ProductDetail.jsx receives slug in URL params
    ↓
Calls getProductBySlug(slug)
    ↓
WooCommerce: GET /products?slug={slug}
    ↓
Returns product array, take first result
    ↓
Use product.id to fetch variations
    ↓
WooCommerce: GET /products/{id}/variations
    ↓
Display product with all data ✅
```

### SimilarProducts URLs:
```
navigate(`/product/${product.slug}`)
```
- All products use slugs for SEO-friendly URLs
- slugs like: "zanobia-a18-silicon-hookah-head"
- NOT numeric IDs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Still getting 404 errors?
**Check:**
1. Did you hard refresh? (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
2. Is dev server running without errors?
3. Are product slugs correct in WooCommerce?
4. Try incognito/private mode

### Products not loading?
**Check:**
1. WooCommerce API credentials in `.env.local`
2. Network tab shows successful API responses
3. Products are in `publish` status in WooCommerce
4. Console shows authentication errors or network errors

### Scroll arrow still clickable?
**Check:**
1. Hard refresh browser
2. Inspect element → verify `pointer-events: none` in styles
3. Try clicking directly on arrow vs. nearby products

## 📚 Technical Details

### WooCommerce API Endpoints Used:
```
GET /products?slug={slug}           # Fetch by slug
GET /products/{id}                  # Fetch by ID (legacy)
GET /products/{id}/variations       # Fetch variations
GET /products?category={id}         # Category-based
GET /products?featured=true         # Featured products
GET /products?orderby=popularity    # Popular products
```

### URL Structure:
```
/product/mazaya-golden-stripes-glass-large  ← Slug (SEO-friendly)
NOT: /product/12345                         ← ID (not SEO-friendly)
```

### Navigation:
```jsx
navigate(`/product/${product.slug}`)  ✅ Correct
navigate(`/product/${product.id}`)    ❌ Would cause 404
```
