# Address Autocomplete Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Core Address Autocomplete System**
- 📍 Free address search using Nominatim OpenStreetMap API
- 🇨🇦🇺🇸 Restricted to Canada and United States only
- 🔍 Live search with dropdown suggestions (≥3 characters)
- 📱 Geolocation support ("Use My Current Location")
- ⌨️ Full keyboard navigation (↑ ↓ Enter Escape)
- 🎨 Beautiful, responsive UI with dark mode

### 2. **Edit Profile Page (`/account/edit`)**
- **Dual Address Sections:**
  - Current Address (Billing)
  - Mailing/Shipping Address
- **Smart Toggle:** "Mailing/shipping address is the same as current address"
  - Auto-syncs addresses when enabled
  - Independent fields when disabled
- **Address Autocomplete:** Integrated in both sections
- **Pre-filled Data:** Fetches saved addresses from WordPress
- **Conditional Business Fields:** Shows business info for business accounts
- **Elegant Design:** Glassmorphic cards with soft neumorphism

### 3. **Checkout Page (`/checkout`)**
- **Pre-filled User Data:** Auto-loads for logged-in users
  - Name, email, phone
  - Billing address (from current address)
  - Shipping address (from saved shipping/billing)
- **Dual Address Forms:**
  - Billing Address with autocomplete
  - Shipping Address with autocomplete
- **Same Address Toggle:** "Same as billing" for shipping
- **Dynamic Shipping Cost:** ClickShip rates update based on postal code
- **Guest Checkout:** Clean forms for non-logged-in users
- **Validation:** Ensures all required fields before order creation
- **Clover Integration:** Sends correct addresses to payment gateway

### 4. **WordPress Backend**
- **Updated Plugin:** `zanobia-business-accounts.php`
- **New Field Support:** Handles both current and shipping addresses
- **Backward Compatibility:** Still supports old field names
- **WooCommerce Meta:** Saves to `billing_*` and `shipping_*` meta keys
- **REST API Endpoints:**
  - `/zanobia/v1/update-profile` - Updates profile & addresses
  - `/zanobia/v1/user-addresses` - Fetches billing & shipping addresses

- ✅ User consent for location access
- ✅ Country restriction enforced client & server

### WordPress
- ✅ JWT authentication for all API calls
- ✅ Sanitization of all input fields
- ✅ Permission checks (logged-in users only)
- ✅ WooCommerce meta field compliance

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### API Calls
- **Debouncing:** 500ms prevents excessive searches
- **Rate Limiting:** 1 req/sec to Nominatim (enforced)
- **Caching:** Suggestions stored during session
- **Abort Controllers:** Cancels outdated requests

### React
- **useCallback:** Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo:** Memoizes computed values (if needed)
- **Lazy Loading:** Components load on-demand
- **Code Splitting:** Reduces initial bundle size

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Frontend (React)
```bash
# All changes are already in your codebase
# Just build and deploy:
cd my-shop
npm run build
# Upload dist/ to your hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
```

### Backend (WordPress)
```bash
# Upload updated plugin file:
1. Connect to your WordPress server (FTP/cPanel)
2. Navigate to: /wp-content/plugins/zanobia-business-accounts/
3. Replace zanobia-business-accounts.php with updated version
4. Go to WP Admin → Plugins
5. Ensure plugin is Active
6. Test REST API endpoints
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test these URLs:
https://go.zanobiaonline.com/wp-json/zanobia/v1/user-addresses
https://go.zanobiaonline.com/wp-json/zanobia/v1/update-profile

# Expected: 401 (not authenticated) or user data (if logged in)
# Should NOT be 404 (route not found)
```
