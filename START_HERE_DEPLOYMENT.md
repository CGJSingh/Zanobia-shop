## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Understanding Your Setup**

### **Will This Conflict With WordPress?**

**NO! Here's why:**

```
Current Setup:
└─ /public_html/
   ├─ index.php          ← Old WordPress site (STAYS HERE)
   ├─ wp-admin/          ← WordPress admin (UNTOUCHED)
   ├─ wp-content/        ← WordPress content (UNTOUCHED)
   └─ website_1b2a8b7a/  ← NEW React app (SEPARATE FOLDER)
```

### **URLs After Deployment:**

```
WordPress Backend (API):
https://www.zanobiaonline.com/wp-admin/
https://www.zanobiaonline.com/wp-json/

React Frontend (Your Shop):
https://www.zanobiaonline.com/website_1b2a8b7a/
```

### **They're completely separate!**
- React app in subfolder: `website_1b2a8b7a/`
- WordPress stays in root: `/public_html/`
- **NO CONFLICTS!**
