# ✅ Edit Profile & User Data - Quick Fixes

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### **1. API URL Error (404) - FIXED ✅**

**Problem:**
```
Error: No route was found matching the URL and request method
URL was: /wp/v2/zanobia/v1/user-role (WRONG)
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Changed baseURL in user.js
From: API_CONFIG.WORDPRESS.BASE_URL (included /wp/v2)
To: 'https://go.zanobiaonline.com/wp-json'

Now calls: /zanobia/v1/user-role (CORRECT)
```

---

### **2. JSX Syntax Error - FIXED ✅**

**Problem:**
```
Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped
```

**Fix:**
```
Fixed JSX structure in EditProfilePage.jsx
Properly closed conditional rendering
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: WordPress Plugin Update Required

**The Edit Profile page will work AFTER you upload the updated plugin!**

###  **Quick Steps:**

1. **File to upload:**
   ```
   d:\Zanobia\website\my-shop\wordpress-plugin\zanobia-business-accounts.php
   ```

2. **cPanel File Manager:**
   ```
   Navigate to: /public_html/wp-content/plugins/zanobia-business-accounts/
   Delete old: zanobia-business-accounts.php
   Upload new: zanobia-business-accounts.php
   ```

3. **No need to reactivate** - just replace the file!

4. **Verify:**
   ```
   Visit: https://go.zanobiaonline.com/wp-json/zanobia/v1
   Should show 8 endpoints (was 5, now 8)
   ```

## 🧪 Test After Plugin Update

### **Edit Profile Should Now:**

1. **Load page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/account/edit
   ```

2. **See:**
   - ✅ Loading skeleton (2-3 seconds)
   - ✅ Form pre-fills with YOUR data
   - ✅ Name, phone, address populated
   - ✅ Business fields if you're business user

3. **Edit & Save:**
   - ✅ Change any field
   - ✅ Click "Save Changes"
   - ✅ See "Saving..." spinner
   - ✅ Toast: "Profile updated successfully!"
   - ✅ Redirect to /account

4. **Verify WordPress:**
   - ✅ WordPress → Users → Your User
   - ✅ User meta updated

## 🛒 Checkout Pre-fill (Coming Next)

**Once Edit Profile works, I'll add:**

1. **Auto pre-fill checkout fields:**
   - Fetch user's saved address
   - Pre-populate billing form
   - Pre-populate shipping form

2. **"Use Different Shipping Address" toggle:**
   ```jsx
   ☐ Ship to a different address
   
   If checked → Show separate shipping form
   If unchecked → Use billing address for shipping
   ```

3. **"Save Address to Profile" option:**
   ```jsx
   ☐ Save this address to my account
   
   After successful order → Updates user meta
   ```

4. **Dynamic shipping cost:**
   - Already works with ClickShip
   - Updates when address changes
   - Real-time calculation

2. Go to: /public_html/wp-content/plugins/zanobia-business-accounts/
3. Delete: zanobia-business-accounts.php
4. Upload: zanobia-business-accounts.php (from local computer)
5. Done!
```

### **Step 2: Test Edit Profile**

```
1. http://localhost:3000/account/edit

```

### **Step 3: Let Me Know**

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

### **If still getting 404 errors:**

**Check this URL in browser:**
```
https://go.zanobiaonline.com/wp-json/zanobia/v1/user-role
```

**Should see:**
```
{"code":"rest_forbidden","message":"Sorry, you are not allowed to do that.","data":{"status":401}}
```
(401 is expected when not logged in - means endpoint exists!)

**If you see 404:**
- Plugin not uploaded correctly
- Plugin not activated
- Permalinks need flushing

**Fix:**
```
WordPress → Settings → Permalinks → Save Changes
(Flushes rewrite rules)
```
